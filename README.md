DART Learn
=======================

The DART Learn is a a web-based online learning platform with learning modules based on the DART Curriculum. Each learning module will be dedicated to one topic of online deception, starting with a 60-second video to give a motivational, engaging, and simple overview of the topic, aimed at our older adult demographic. Longer video tutorials given by the domain experts in our team, reading materials and resource links will also be provided for users who would want to spend more time on the learning platform. Our goal is to deliver a dynamic, interactive, and contextually meaningful learner-centered environment designed for older adults with their input.

This current iteration is to practise building the DART Learn.
